TIME LIMITS / CANCELLATION PROVISIONS 
All liability insurance required pursuant to this policy shall provide coverage for a sufficient time period to protect the City from liability. The insurer is required to provide a minimum of thirty (30) days-notice of cancellation of any policy. With the approval of the City Attorney (except as provided in section 4, herein) this obligation may be reduced to not less than ten (10) days written notice, but only for termination due to the non-payment of any premium. In no event shall a policy be accepted which terminates prior to the completion of the activity to be covered. 
In certain circumstances, it may be impracticable to obtain continuing insurance coverage due to the duration of the activity or the cost of premature renewal. Under such circumstances, an exception to the coverage period may be made so long as the policy is renewed or replaced with an acceptable insurance carrier and there is no lapse in coverage. Maintenance of proper insurance coverage is a material term of any contract with the City and failure to maintain or renew coverage or to provide evidence of renewal may be treated as a material breach of contract. 

ALTERNATIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; SELF-INSURANCE; RISK-POOLING 
Alternative risk management practices, such as self-insurance, risk pooling, risk retention groups, and other such programs, will be accepted in lieu of commercial insurance policies provided that the coverage meets the requirements of this Policy. Any such alternative risk management practices must meet the financial strength and surplus requirements reflected by the Best's Ratings required of commercial insurance under this Policy.
